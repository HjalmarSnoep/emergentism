# emergentism
## TLDR 
Emergentism challenges reductionism by embracing complexity and recognizing the subjective nature of reality shaped by cultural conditioning. It can be seen as a scientific attitude, a non-magical holistic approach to religion, a cinematic/artistic form, or an architectural movement. It views religion, language, and art as ways of preserving and distributing cultural information. The image of Yggdrasil symbolizes the interconnectedness of different cultural conditioning. Language is fundamental to human culture and communication, while religion serves as a way of preserving cultural information. Emergentism emphasizes the subjective nature of reality and challenges absolute truths.

## expressions of emergentism
### TLDR:
Emergentism is a multifaceted concept that can be seen as a worldview, scientific attitude, religion, or artform. It challenges the idea of factual reality, acknowledging the symbolic nature of human thinking. Cultural conditioning shapes our perception of reality, including concepts of right and wrong, truth and falsehood. Yggdrasil, a mythical tree in Norse mythology, symbolizes emergentism with roots representing fear of dissolution and branches representing incompatible cultural conditioning. Emergentism invites us to embrace being wrong, acknowledge complexity, and constantly evolve our understanding.

### TS;NR
Emergentism is a lot, but most of all it is not a copyrighted work, mostly because this idea is not finished, it´s wrong and it can never be finished and will always be wrong..

- It can be seen as a worldview, where everything that humans do or are involved in is an expression of emergentism.
- It can be seen as scientific attitude to reduce reductionism by embracing complexity
- It can be seen as a religion (a nong-magical wholisme)
- It can be seen as a artform
   - cinematic stream (starting with the Matrix)
   - It can be seen as a graphic artform (painting, eidetic organicism - AI-augmented)
   - It can be seen as a architectural movement stemming from biomorphism

Emergentism is the realisation, that first of all.. first and foremost, you are wrong.
It is also the art of being wrong..You can only be wrong, but you can make a contribution to an emerging truth that can never ever be reached.

This meand that how you view reality is not factual. It isn´t literal.
The reason being thinking and understanding are symbolic and reality is not.

Upon this basis of symbols that each individual human must make for theirselves,is a cultural conditioning that runs way deeper than
peoapl are inclined to think. For instance the language this is written in, is a cultural convention and you are only able to read it
because of cultural condition.
The whole idea of right and wrong is an artifact of the human brain, which tends to think in opposites, and splits things in good and bad (or handy and not handy)
- the ideas that things exist and that they can be placed on a range of spectra is an artifact of the human brain (waterfall hinking)
-the idea that things can be true (benificial for reasoning, so good) or false (not to be regarded when reasoning, so bad) are artifacts of the human brain as are more nuanced versions of this: significant and unsignificant.

- but WHAT is right or wrong (morals) is cultural conditioning.
- but where things are placed and in what spectrum (context) they are seen is cultural conditioning
- but what is true and false is cultural conditioning.

The image of Yggdrasil is seen as one of the first emergentist images.
The roots of the tree lie in Niflheim, a cold place where dead warriors go, that don´t go to walhalla, later explained as a hell, ruled over by the godess Hell and seen as a punishment for vikings that weren´t brave (the punishemnt of dissolution) the method of dissolution for the vikings was ice, they stood around in freezing blood, under the ribs of the word-serpent. Later the prefered methos of dissolution was fire.. But in either case it is the fear of the living for the state of deadness.

In the branches of Yggdrasil lay nine worlds that were constanly at war with eacht other. This is a recognistion of people grouping together and culturally conditioning each other, but the cultural conditioning turning out to be incompatible and the people in e particular "world" holding their conditioning as "true" and "true" in high regard.


## Religion, culture, language and art
### TLDR
Emergentism sees religion, language, and art as interconnected means of preserving and distributing cultural information. Religion involves belief systems, rituals, and practices passed down through generations. Language is a fundamental aspect of human culture, facilitating communication and symbolizing information. Art reflects cultural context, conveying complex ideas and emotions. These forms of expression are not isolated, but intertwined and shaped through interactions among individuals and communities. They serve as repositories of cultural information, shaping identities, beliefs, and practices. Art can also bridge gaps between different societies. Emergentism recognizes the dynamic and evolving nature of these phenomena in shaping societies and cultures.

### TS;NR
Emergentism views religion, language, and art as ways in which information is preserved and distributed throughout history or within a society or culture. Here's a brief explanation for each aspect:

Religion: Religion often involves belief systems, rituals, and practices that are passed down through generations and shape the worldview, values, and behaviors of a community. These beliefs and practices are typically distributed (evangelism and initiation) among the members of the community through oral traditions, scriptures, teachings, ceremonies, and other means. Religion can serve as a way of preserving and transmitting cultural information, such as moral codes, explanations of the natural world (kosmogony), and ideas about hoe to view life, a possible meaning of life (that created cultural patterns that are viewed as beneficial) and an attitude toward life and death, like the possible existence of an afterlife..

Language: Language is a fundamental aspect of human culture and communication. A healthy human brain has several structures that facilitate the production of language (areas of Broca, Wernicke Leibniz, Meisner) and abstract thought and other ways of symbolising. The structure of these areas will be found to exhibit striking similarities with organizations of neural nets (like the GAN-structure or just the organisation of hidden layers) These strcutures can be seen as very complex filters, condensing information. THis condensed or symbolised information is the used for reassoning and language is a natural extension of this process. It allows for the expression of thoughts, ideas, and knowledge, and facilitates social interaction and cooperation. Language is learned and transmitted through generations, and different languages carry unique cultural nuances, worldviews, and historical experiences and traums. Language serves as a means of preserving and distributing cultural information, including stories, myths, customs, traumsas and traditions, across generations and communities.

Art: Art, in its various forms such as visual arts, music, literature, and dance, often reflects the cultural, social, and historical context in which it emerges. Often it emerges as an opposing force to the prevailing ideas in a soceity, deliberately taking a different viewpoint. Art can convey complex ideas, emotions, and experiences in symbolic or aesthetic ways, and can serve as a means of expressing and preserving cultural information. Even when it opposes the culture it emerges from. Because any opposition is still an indication of the originally opposed. Artistic expression often triggers very primitive parts of the brain (appeal, esthethic sense) and is therefore valued not just for its cultural or abstract content, but for this more primitive and less abstract appeal and perserved even when the orignial ideas that prompted the art are forgotten or seen as alien by the natural progression of a culture. This way the information can still be passed down through generations and can provide insights into a culture's values, beliefs, and perspectives, serving as a distributed repository of cultural information. Where language and aand religion can be seen as ways preserving information in a living society. Art is a way of exchanging between societies that are vastly different.

In all these cases, emergentism recognizes that religion, language, and art are not isolated phenomena (or even exist as "ding an sich") , but rather interconnected and distributed ways in which cultural information is preserved, transmitted, and shaped within a society or culture. These forms of expression can evolve and emerge over time as a result of complex interactions among individuals and communities, and can play a significant role in shaping cultural identities, beliefs, and practices.

## Trauma
### TLDR
Emergentism is a philosophical worldview that recognizes knowledge and understanding as unattainable goals, evolving through collective efforts from diverse perspectives. It acknowledges biases, including cultural, parental, ancestral, and personal traumas, which can influence perspectives. However, emergentism emphasizes self-awareness, critical thinking, and mindfulness to mitigate biases. Biases are inherent in human cognition, but an emergentist can strive to minimize their impact by being transparent, acknowledging limitations, and seeking feedback from diverse perspectives. By doing so, emergentists can make meaningful contributions while actively mitigating biases.

### TS;NR
Emergentism, as a philosophical perspective or worldview, recognizes
that knowledge and understanding are ultimately a unattainable goal and 
necessarily evolves through collective efforts of people
from different cultures, backgrounds, and perspectives. 
It acknowledges that biases, including cultural or ancestral trauma, can influence an individual's perspectives 
and contributions. However, emergentism also emphasizes the importance of self-awareness and critical thinking.

A trauma is defined as a event that has made a lasting change in the likes/dislikes of a group, individual or culture.
There are three types of trauma:
-cultural
Examples of cultural trauma are, the plight of the enslaved, dislodged and then wandering Jews and their insistence of Israel being Kanaan and the conflict with the original inhabitants that oppose them.
Or the Finnish intranslatable "sisu", which is an attitude of pluckiness and grittiness, which is a cultural reaction to many wars and invasions.

-parental trauma
Since a child is educated by the trinity of parents, siblings/peers and educators, the influence of a trauma in any of these pillars is enormous. A parent (or sibling or teacher) with a deep personal trauma can create trauma in dependents because of overcompensation or other coping methods.

-ancestral
Beyond culture, humand have been faced with many dangers that might be encoded in DNA, like a fear of snakes, dark, spiders etc.
These DNA changes might be epigenetical or genetical in nature.

-personal
A individual human may go through obvious trauma like a car accident or a single terrible happening that may take a long time to process including flashbacks, subtle trauma like a rejection that changes the way the self is seen without anyone noticeable effect on beheviour directly, or commplex trauma of small wounds to the psyche often repeated. These types of trauma also exist for Cultures and ancestors. combinations of these types of traumas can last enormously long.

An emergentist may accept that they may not be able to completely shed their biases, 
including cultural or ancestral trauma, but they can strive to be aware of them (all the time knowing that complete awarenss of them is impossible and any such idea must be acepted as inevitable) and 
actively work to mitigate their influence without the hope of ever succeeding completely but maybe succeeding enough. 
Also the responsibility of "getting it right" is shared with many, many others and this creates a freedom to adapt the understanding of emergentism to the needs of the moment for a society or individual.

A great tool is mindfulness, but since this has become a quite vague term, I will explain what I mean with this.
It involves engaging in introspection, examining one's own assumptions and biases, not repressing but feeling emotions, regardless of them making sense, not repressing any thoughts but also not engaging with them, believing them, identifying with them or expanding on them, and being open to feedback and perspectives from others. It may also involve seeking diverse sources of information and engaging in collaborative efforts with individuals from different backgrounds to gain a more holistic and inclusive understanding of complex issues.

Additionally, an emergentist may recognize that biases are an inherent part of human cognition and that complete objectivity is unattainable. 
However, they can strive to minimize the impact of biases on their contributions by being transparent about their perspectives, acknowledging potential limitations, and subjecting their ideas to rigorous scrutiny and feedback from a diverse range of perspectives.

An emergentist may acknowledge the presence of biases, including cultural or ancestral trauma, and strive to be self-aware, open to diverse perspectives, and transparent about their perspectives and limitations. By doing so, they can make meaningful contributions while actively mitigating the influence of biases on their work.

Because of the epoch we the author finds himself in and because of the way "law" and "copyright"is now regarded and structured, the author feels a need to be very precise in the license of these ideas. Therefor the whole of this document is in the public domain and seen as "beyond copyright".

Emergentism, as a worldview or philosophical perspective, emphasizes the collaborative and evolving nature of human knowledge and understanding. Also it recognises that the ultimate goal of understanding cannot be reached because of the nature of understanding. So a self-respecting work can never be finished or closed. It recognizes that knowledge and ideas emerge and evolve through collective efforts of people from different cultures, backgrounds, and perspectives and can ALWAYS be improved or at least adapter to cultural or personal needs. This has to do with the emergentist view of optimization (there is no "best way", without a very clear optimizational context, there can only the most effective way to reach some very well documented goal, given a very well documented set of existing universe)

Creative Commons license, which is a type of open license that allows for sharing and distribution of creative works with certain permissions and conditions, is important for emergentism as it promotes the principles of collaboration, sharing, and openness. And counteracts the biases of law as it is viewed thses days, by using law. Playing their game, but better than them, the eternal plight of the serious emergentist. By using a Creative Commons license, individuals or communities can make their work available to others for reuse, adaptation, and further development, fostering a collaborative and inclusive approach to knowledge creation and dissemination.

The use of Creative Commons license can help to facilitate the exchange of ideas, encourage participation, and enable diverse contributions to the emergentist discourse without the limitations of copyright or proprietary restrictions. It can also promote the idea that emergentism is an ongoing, collective effort of humanity, transcending cultural boundaries and fostering a sense of shared ownership and collaboration in the pursuit of knowledge and understanding.

In summary, Creative Commons license can be significant for emergentism as it aligns with the collaborative and inclusive nature of this worldview, allowing for the open exchange of ideas and fostering a sense of collective effort towards the ongoing development of knowledge and understanding.
