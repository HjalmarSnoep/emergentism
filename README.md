# emergentism
## TLDR 
Emergentism challenges reductionism by embracing complexity and recognizing the subjective nature of reality shaped by cultural conditioning. It can be seen as a scientific attitude, a non-magical holistic approach to religion, a cinematic/artistic form, or an architectural movement. It views religion, language, and art as ways of preserving and distributing cultural information. The image of Yggdrasil symbolizes the interconnectedness of different cultural conditioning. Language is fundamental to human culture and communication, while religion serves as a way of preserving cultural information. Emergentism emphasizes the subjective nature of reality and challenges absolute truths.


## expressions of emergentism
### TLDR:
Emergentism is a multifaceted concept that can be seen as a worldview, scientific attitude, religion, or artform. It challenges the idea of factual reality, acknowledging the symbolic nature of human thinking. Cultural conditioning shapes our perception of reality, including concepts of right and wrong, truth and falsehood. Yggdrasil, a mythical tree in Norse mythology, symbolizes emergentism with roots representing fear of dissolution and branches representing incompatible cultural conditioning. Emergentism invites us to embrace being wrong, acknowledge complexity, and constantly evolve our understanding.

### TW;DW
Emergentism is a lot, but most of all it is not a copyrighted work, mostly because this idea is not finished, it´s wrong and it can never be finished and will always be wrong..

- It can be seen as a worldview, where everything that humans do or are involved in is an expression of emergentism.
- It can be seen as scientific attitude to reduce reductionism by embracing complexity
- It can be seen as a religion (a nong-magical wholisme)
- It can be seen as a artform
   - cinematic stream (starting with the Matrix)
   - It can be seen as a graphic artform (painting, eidetic organicism - AI-augmented)
   - It can be seen as a architectural movement stemming from biomorphism

Emergentism is the realisation, that first of all.. first and foremost, you are wrong.
It is also the art of being wrong..You can only be wrong, but you can make a contribution to an emerging truth that can never ever be reached.

This meand that how you view reality is not factual. It isn´t literal.
The reason being thinking and understanding are symbolic and reality is not.

Upon this basis of symbols that each individual human must make for theirselves,is a cultural conditioning that runs way deeper than
peoapl are inclined to think. For instance the language this is written in, is a cultural convention and you are only able to read it
because of cultural condition.
The whole idea of right and wrong is an artifact of the human brain, which tends to think in opposites, and splits things in good and bad (or handy and not handy)
- the ideas that things exist and that they can be placed on a range of spectra is an artifact of the human brain (waterfall hinking)
-the idea that things can be true (benificial for reasoning, so good) or false (not to be regarded when reasoning, so bad) are artifacts of the human brain as are more nuanced versions of this: significant and unsignificant.

,but WHAT is right or wrong (morals) is cultural conditioning.
-but where things are placed and in what spectrum (context) they are seen is cultural conditioning
-but what is true and false is cultural conditioning.

The image of Yggdrasil is seen as one of the first emergentist images.
The roots of the tree lie in Niflheim, a cold place where dead warriors go, that don´t go to walhalla, later explained as a hell, ruled over by the godess Hell and seen as a punishment for vikings that weren´t brave (the punishemnt of dissolution) the method of dissolution for the vikings was ice, they stood around in freezing blood, under the ribs of the word-serpent. Later the prefered methos of dissolution was fire.. But in either case it is the fear of the living for the state of deadness.

In the branches of Yggdrasil lay nine worlds that were constanly at war with eacht other. This is a recognistion of people grouping together and culturally conditioning each other, but the cultural conditioning turning out to be incompatible and the people in e particular "world" holding their conditioning as "true" and "true" in high regard.


## Religion, culture, language and art
### TLDR - Summary written Chat GPT3.5:
Emergentism sees religion, language, and art as interconnected means of preserving and distributing cultural information. Religion involves belief systems, rituals, and practices passed down through generations. Language is a fundamental aspect of human culture, facilitating communication and symbolizing information. Art reflects cultural context, conveying complex ideas and emotions. These forms of expression are not isolated, but intertwined and shaped through interactions among individuals and communities. They serve as repositories of cultural information, shaping identities, beliefs, and practices. Art can also bridge gaps between different societies. Emergentism recognizes the dynamic and evolving nature of these phenomena in shaping societies and cultures.

### TW;DW
Emergentism views religion, language, and art as ways in which information is preserved and distributed throughout history or within a society or culture. Here's a brief explanation for each aspect:

Religion: Religion often involves belief systems, rituals, and practices that are passed down through generations and shape the worldview, values, and behaviors of a community. These beliefs and practices are typically distributed (evangelism and initiation) among the members of the community through oral traditions, scriptures, teachings, ceremonies, and other means. Religion can serve as a way of preserving and transmitting cultural information, such as moral codes, explanations of the natural world (kosmogony), and ideas about hoe to view life, a possible meaning of life (that created cultural patterns that are viewed as beneficial) and an attitude toward life and death, like the possible existence of an afterlife..

Language: Language is a fundamental aspect of human culture and communication. A healthy human brain has several structures that facilitate the production of language (areas of Broca, Wernicke Leibniz, Meisner) and abstract thought and other ways of symbolising. The structure of these areas will be found to exhibit striking similarities with organizations of neural nets (like the GAN-structure or just the organisation of hidden layers) These strcutures can be seen as very complex filters, condensing information. THis condensed or symbolised information is the used for reassoning and language is a natural extension of this process. It allows for the expression of thoughts, ideas, and knowledge, and facilitates social interaction and cooperation. Language is learned and transmitted through generations, and different languages carry unique cultural nuances, worldviews, and historical experiences and traums. Language serves as a means of preserving and distributing cultural information, including stories, myths, customs, traumsas and traditions, across generations and communities.

Art: Art, in its various forms such as visual arts, music, literature, and dance, often reflects the cultural, social, and historical context in which it emerges. Often it emerges as an opposing force to the prevailing ideas in a soceity, deliberately taking a different viewpoint. Art can convey complex ideas, emotions, and experiences in symbolic or aesthetic ways, and can serve as a means of expressing and preserving cultural information. Even when it opposes the culture it emerges from. Because any opposition is still an indication of the originally opposed. Artistic expression often triggers very primitive parts of the brain (appeal, esthethic sense) and is therefore valued not just for its cultural or abstract content, but for this more primitive and less abstract appeal and perserved even when the orignial ideas that prompted the art are forgotten or seen as alien by the natural progression of a culture. This way the information can still be passed down through generations and can provide insights into a culture's values, beliefs, and perspectives, serving as a distributed repository of cultural information. Where language and aand religion can be seen as ways preserving information in a living society. Art is a way of exchanging between societies that are vastly different.

In all these cases, emergentism recognizes that religion, language, and art are not isolated phenomena (or even exist as "ding an sich") , but rather interconnected and distributed ways in which cultural information is preserved, transmitted, and shaped within a society or culture. These forms of expression can evolve and emerge over time as a result of complex interactions among individuals and communities, and can play a significant role in shaping cultural identities, beliefs, and practices.
