# emergentism
## TLDR 
Emergentism is a lot of things, but most of all it is not a copyrighted work. Mostly because this idea is not finished, it's wrong and it can never be finished and will always be wrong.

Its emphasis is on entropy as an undeniable main force in the universe (second law of thermodynamics, Kali). And biological complexity deriving from very simple opposing forces (strange attractors from linear equstions, see visual proof repository by same author) and the hallucination of reality by "substantialising" or grouping similar phenomena into "things" and "Ã«vents", that are felt to be undeniable. Deriving abstract reasoning from the assumption of this undeniability created time, space and a person (an I). This creates an ego as a public persona. 
This is the makeup of aa shared hallucination. Shared by a culture and in some regards by the whole human race. 
It is an artifact of the make up of the human brain on the one hand and physiological makeup which requires working together as individuals and created communication as a survival tool.
It answers the [big philisophical question](big philisophical questions) in rather unique ways. You can Click on these kinds of links to end up in the wiki of this repositoriy and explore further.

It can be seen as a worldview, where everything that humans do or are involved in is an expression of emergentism.
It can be seen as a scientific attitude to reduce reductionism by embracing complexity.
It can be seen as a religion (a non-magical wholism).
It can be seen as an art form.
Cinematic stream (starting with the Matrix).
It can be seen as a graphic art form (painting, eidetic organicism - AI-augmented).
It can be seen as an architectural movement stemming from biomorphism.
Emergentism is the realization, that first of all, first and foremost, you are wrong.
It is also the art of being wrong. You can only be wrong, but you can make a contribution to an emerging truth that can never ever be reached.

This means that how you view reality is not factual. It isn't literal.
The reason being thinking and understanding are symbolic and reality is not.

Upon this basis of symbols that each individual human must make for themselves, is a cultural conditioning that runs way deeper than people are inclined to think. For instance, the language this is written in, is a cultural convention and you are only able to read it because of cultural condition.
The whole idea of right and wrong is an artifact of the human brain, which tends to think in opposites, and splits things into good and bad (or handy and not handy).

The idea that things exist and that they can be placed on a range of spectra is an artifact of the human brain (waterfall thinking).

The idea that things can be true (beneficial for reasoning, so good) or false (not to be regarded when reasoning, so bad) are artifacts of the human brain, as are more nuanced versions of this: significant and insignificant.

But WHAT is right or wrong (morals) is cultural conditioning.

But where things are placed and in what spectrum (context) they are seen is cultural conditioning.

But what is true and false is cultural conditioning.

The image of Yggdrasil is seen as one of the first emergentist images.
The roots of the tree lie in Niflheim, a cold place where dead warriors go, that don't go to Valhalla, later explained as a hell, ruled over by the goddess Hel and seen as a punishment for Vikings that weren't brave (the punishment of dissolution). The method of dissolution for the Vikings was ice, they stood around in freezing blood, under the ribs of the word-serpent. Later the preferred method of dissolution was fire. But in either case, it is the fear of the living for the state of deadness.

In the branches of Yggdrasil lay nine worlds that were constantly at war with each other. This is a recognition of people grouping together and culturally conditioning each other, but the cultural conditioning turning out to be incompatible, and the people in a particular "world" holding their conditioning as "true" and "good" in high regard.

## Religion, culture, language and art
### TLDR
Emergentism sees religion, language, and art as interconnected means of preserving and distributing cultural information. Religion involves belief systems, rituals, and practices passed down through generations. Language is a fundamental aspect of human culture, facilitating communication and symbolizing information. Art reflects cultural context, conveying complex ideas and emotions. These forms of expression are not isolated, but intertwined and shaped through interactions among individuals and communities. They serve as repositories of cultural information, shaping identities, beliefs, and practices. Art can also bridge gaps between different societies. Emergentism recognizes the dynamic and evolving nature of these phenomena in shaping societies and cultures.

### TS;NR
Emergentism views religion, language, and art as ways in which information is preserved and distributed throughout history or within a society or culture. Here's a brief explanation for each aspect:

Religion: Religion often involves belief systems, rituals, and practices that are passed down through generations and shape the worldview, values, and behaviors of a community. These beliefs and practices are typically distributed (through evangelism and initiation) among the members of the community through oral traditions, scriptures, teachings, ceremonies, and other means. Religion can serve as a way of preserving and transmitting cultural information, such as moral codes, explanations of the natural world (kosmogony), ideas about how to view life, and possible meanings of life (that create cultural patterns viewed as beneficial), as well as attitudes toward life and death, such as the possible existence of an afterlife.

Language: Language is a fundamental aspect of human culture and communication. A healthy human brain has several structures that facilitate the production of language (areas of Broca, Wernicke, Leibniz, Meisner) and abstract thought and other ways of symbolizing. The structure of these areas exhibits striking similarities with the organization of neural nets (like the GAN-structure or just the organization of hidden layers). These structures can be seen as very complex filters, condensing information. This condensed or symbolized information is then used for reasoning, and language is a natural extension of this process. It allows for the expression of thoughts, ideas, and knowledge and facilitates social interaction and cooperation. Language is learned and transmitted through generations, and different languages carry unique cultural nuances, worldviews, historical experiences, and traumas. Language serves as a means of preserving and distributing cultural information, including stories, myths, customs, traumas, and traditions, across generations and communities.

Art: Art, in its various forms such as visual arts, music, literature, and dance, often reflects the cultural, social, and historical context in which it emerges. Often it emerges as an opposing force to the prevailing ideas in a society, deliberately taking a different viewpoint. Art can convey complex ideas, emotions, and experiences in symbolic or aesthetic ways and can serve as a means of expressing and preserving cultural information, even when it opposes the culture it emerges from, because any opposition is still an indication of the original opposition. Artistic expression often triggers very primitive parts of the brain (appeal, aesthetic sense) and is therefore valued not just for its cultural or abstract content, but for this more primitive and less abstract appeal, and preserved even when the original ideas that prompted the art are forgotten or seen as alien by the natural progression of a culture. This way, the information can still be passed down through generations and can provide insights into a culture's values, beliefs, and perspectives, serving as a distributed repository of cultural information. Where language and religion can be seen as ways of preserving information in a living society, art is a way of exchanging between societies that are vastly different.

In all these cases, emergentism recognizes that religion, language, and art are not isolated phenomena (or even exist as "ding an sich"), but rather interconnected and distributed ways in which cultural information is preserved, transmitted, and shaped within a society or culture. These forms of expression can evolve and emerge over time as a result of complex interactions among individuals and communities and can play a significant role in shaping cultural identities, beliefs, and practices.

## Trauma
### TLDR
Emergentism is a philosophical worldview that recognizes knowledge and understanding as unattainable goals, evolving through collective efforts from diverse perspectives. It acknowledges biases, including cultural, parental, ancestral, and personal traumas, which can influence perspectives. However, emergentism emphasizes self-awareness, critical thinking, and mindfulness to mitigate biases. Biases are inherent in human cognition, but an emergentist can strive to minimize their impact by being transparent, acknowledging limitations, and seeking feedback from diverse perspectives. By doing so, emergentists can make meaningful contributions while actively mitigating biases.

### TS;NR
Emergentism, as a philosophical perspective or worldview, recognizes that knowledge and understanding are ultimately unattainable goals and necessarily evolve through the collective efforts of people from different cultures, backgrounds, and perspectives. It acknowledges that biases, including cultural or ancestral trauma, can influence an individual's perspectives and contributions. However, emergentism also emphasizes the importance of self-awareness and critical thinking.

Trauma is defined as an event that has a lasting impact on the likes/dislikes of a group, individual, or culture. There are three types of trauma:

Cultural trauma: Examples of cultural trauma include the plight of the enslaved, dislodged, and wandering Jews and their insistence on Israel being Kanaan, resulting in conflict with the original inhabitants who oppose them. Another example is the Finnish concept of "sisu," which is an attitude of pluckiness and grittiness that is a cultural reaction to many wars and invasions.

Parental trauma: Since a child is educated by the trinity of parents, siblings/peers, and educators, the influence of trauma in any of these pillars is enormous. A parent, sibling, or teacher with deep personal trauma can create trauma in dependents due to overcompensation or other coping methods.

Ancestral trauma: Beyond culture, humans have faced many dangers that might be encoded in DNA, such as a fear of snakes, darkness, spiders, etc. These DNA changes might be epigenetic or genetic in nature.

Personal trauma: An individual human may experience obvious trauma, such as a car accident or a single terrible event that may take a long time to process, including flashbacks. Subtle trauma, such as rejection that changes the way the self is perceived without any noticeable effect on behavior directly, or complex trauma of small wounds to the psyche often repeated, also exist for cultures and ancestors. Combinations of these types of traumas can last for a long time.

An emergentist may accept that they may not be able to completely shed their biases, including cultural or ancestral trauma, but they can strive to be aware of them (while knowing that complete awareness is impossible and must be accepted as inevitable) and actively work to mitigate their influence without the hope of ever fully succeeding, but perhaps succeeding enough. The responsibility of "getting it right" is shared with many others, creating the freedom to adapt the understanding of emergentism to the needs of the moment for a society or individual.

A great tool for this is mindfulness, but since this has become a vague term, I will explain what I mean by it. Mindfulness involves engaging in introspection, examining one's own assumptions and biases, not repressing but feeling emotions regardless of whether they make sense, not repressing any thoughts but also not engaging with them, believing them, identifying with them, or expanding on them. It also involves being open to feedback and perspectives from others, seeking diverse sources of information, and engaging in collaborative efforts with individuals from different backgrounds to gain a more holistic and inclusive understanding of complex issues.

Additionally, an emergentist may recognize that biases are an inherent part of human cognition and that complete objectivity is unattainable. However, they can strive to minimize the impact of biases on their contributions by being transparent about their perspectives, acknowledging potential limitations, and subjecting their ideas to rigorous scrutiny and feedback from a diverse range of perspectives.

An emergentist may acknowledge the presence of biases, including cultural or ancestral trauma, and strive to be self-aware, open to diverse perspectives, and transparent about their perspectives and limitations. By doing so, they can make meaningful contributions while actively mitigating the influence of biases on their work.

### TS;NR
Because of particular biases of the epoch the author finds themselves in, on the subjects of "law" and "copyright", and how these notions are regarded and structured, the author feels a need to be very precise in the license of these ideas, using their own game rules against them. Therefore, the whole of this document is in the public domain and seen as "beyond copyright".

Emergentism, as a worldview or philosophical perspective, emphasizes the collaborative and evolving nature of human knowledge and understanding. It also recognizes that the ultimate goal of understanding cannot be reached due to the nature of understanding. So a self-respecting work can never be finished or closed. It recognizes that knowledge and ideas emerge and evolve through the collective efforts of people from different cultures, backgrounds, and perspectives and can ALWAYS be improved or at least adapted to cultural or personal needs. This has to do with the emergentist view of optimization (there is no "best way"; without a very clear optimization context, there can only be the most effective way to reach some well-documented goal, given a well-documented set of existing universes).

Creative Commons license, which is a type of open license that allows for sharing and distribution of creative works with certain permissions and conditions, is important for emergentism as it promotes the principles of collaboration, sharing, and openness. It counteracts the biases of law as they are viewed these days, by using law. Playing their game, but better than them, the eternal plight of the serious emergentist. By using a Creative Commons license, individuals or communities can make their work available to others for reuse, adaptation, and further development, fostering a collaborative and inclusive approach to knowledge creation and dissemination.

The use of Creative Commons license can help facilitate the exchange of ideas, encourage participation, and enable diverse contributions to the emergentist discourse without the limitations of copyright or proprietary restrictions. It can also promote the idea that emergentism is an ongoing, collective effort of humanity, transcending cultural boundaries and fostering a sense of shared ownership and collaboration in the pursuit of knowledge and understanding.

In summary, a Creative Commons license can be significant for emergentism as it aligns with the collaborative and inclusive nature of this worldview, allowing for the open exchange of ideas and fostering a sense of collective effort towards the ongoing development of knowledge and understanding.

### further exploration:
- the five big philosophical questions:
      - Who started it? ( concept of causality, kosmogonies)
      - Are we going to make it? (existential concerns about the meaning and purpose of life,  human nature and the potential for survival or progress is survival the point, is there a point?)
      - Where are we going to put it? (ethics, social organization, and the allocation of resources)
      - Who's going to clean up? (responsibility, accountability, and stewardship, ethics, environmentalism, and the ethical and social responsibility, and the importance of service.)
      - Is it serious? ( meaning, truth, and significance and the hallucination of reality and self, non-duality, the universe as play)

- process of integration and synthesis of other ways of other viewpoints.
